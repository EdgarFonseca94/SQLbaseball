# SQLbaseball

----------------------
I wanted to practice my SQL queries so I found this SQLite baseball database. Here I tried to answer these questions.

1. From 2006 to 2016, which 5 teams had the highest payrolls?

2. Is there any general trend in payrolls over this time period?

3. How do the top 5 teams compare to other teams?

4. Which players had the highest number of homeruns?

5. How win percentage affects attendance?

6. Which teams have the most wins in games and in the World Series?

The overall goal was to practice my SQL queries while answering some interesting questions with this database. I also used plotnine which is a package that allows you to utilize ggplot to make visualizations.
